Please see intallation instruction online at http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/DeCoSTAR/use.html







CMAKE PARAMETERS 

If CMake cannot find the Boost or the Bio++ libraries, try adding the following parameters to the cmake command line using the appropriate directories (assuming the bpp-phyl-2.2.0, bpp-seq-2.2.0, and bpp-core-2.2.0 are in the /home/user/local directory):

cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=/home/local/user/boost -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/local/ -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/user/local/ ..

To use a g++ compiler instead of c++, append the following to the cmake command line:
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ 

If the Bio++ libraries are installed in a non-standard location, their location needs to be specified to run ecceTERA, such as with the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, e.g.:
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/user/local/bpp-core-2.2.0/src:/home/user/local/bpp-seq-2.2.0/src:/home/user/local/bpp-phyl-2.2.0/src
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
