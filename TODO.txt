This is TODO-list of the various things that should be changed/added in DeCoSTAR

  - overflow when counting number of backtrack : sometimes on complex solutions the number of possible backtracks is so high that it overflows.
    - option to deactivate backtrack count
    - flag and abort overflowing NBBT
  - add Adelme's code : 
    - loss aware : taking into account some losses to offer a free adj gains
    - gibbs-sampling-like optimization of linearity through adj scenrios sampling
    - ??multi-threaded version of DeCoSTAR??

  Things to add to the doc:
   - explain that the binary exists and on which platform it has been compiled ( il faut faire make clean avant make all )
   - explain the new options


AdjTree.cpp l.1052 : spcifically test for abreak  because Node.h got report the root if its degree is one, causing node names to be wrongly attributed
