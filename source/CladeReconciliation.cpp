Constructor of the class that uses ecceTERA classes

Takes:
 - CandT (CladesAndTripartitions *): pointer to a CCP distribution instance which only contains the ROOTED gene tree we're reconciling
 - graph (DTLGraph *): a pointer to a graph containing reconciliations (nodes can either represent gene-species mapping or event)
 - speciesTree (MySpeciesTree *): pointer to the species tree
 - recIndex (int): index of the current clade in the reconciliation
 - reconciliation (vector< vector<DTLGraph::MyGraph::Vertex> > *): pointer to the representation of the reconciliation as a vector of vector of nodes in the graph
 - previous (ReconciliationEvent) : the event that led to this clade
 - VERBOSE (bool)
